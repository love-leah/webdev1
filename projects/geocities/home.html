    <h2> Welcome to My Page! </h2>

    <p> I’m Leah and I loveee music! I listen to everything.  A few months ago I watched that “Diva’s Live” show on VH1 and it was good but the line up wasn’t all that… Shania Twain? A diva?? I don’t see it. Not everyone can be a diva. I think a diva has to have singular and brain melting talent. An artist for your life. This page is dedicated to my favorite divas, the ladies I would want on a show if I were in charge at VH1. Click “enter” to  see my picks! Let me know what you think …..
