            Leah Love is a Chicago-based writer who hates writing in the third person. I am currently working on getting a journalism degree. In addition to this, I am trying to perfect my chocolate chip cookie recipe.

            I’ve written and produced audio pieces about rappers, farmer’s markets, therapists, graffiti artists, filmmakers, and veterinarians. I love pop music, history, and writing lists. In my future work, I hope to continue to talk to interesting people, and to highlight how black folks move through and shape the world.
