            <h3>God is Cruel</h3>
            <p>In summer of 2020, Taco Bell dealt a devastating blow to people who are me when they announced that they would be removing all potato items from their menu. As a vegetarian and Taco Bell enthusiast since fall of 2019, this news almost brought me to tears. Sure, the black beans are a solid protein, a respectable meat alternative. I was of course grateful for their continued presence on the menu, a refuge in the hostile terrain of fast-food menu items. And other restaurants still had their potato items – you can’t spit without hitting some guy who can sell you some French fries. But Taco Bell potatoes are different. They’re better. </p>

            <h3>Spud is Thicker Than Water</h3>
            <p>Take it from someone who tried – a Taco Bell potato is hard to recreate. They’re shaped like a slightly rounded off cube. They’re soft, but not mushy, on the inside. Crisp but still soft on the outside. Seasoned but not quite spicy, salted but not quite salty. They’re a perfect golden brown color – a Fenty #345. They’re divine in the spicy soft taco, or as a substitute for meat in any one of the variations on a foodstuff enveloped in a tortilla that TB has to offer. I am partial to them when unencumbered by the wrap, accompanied only by cheese and sour cream as the Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes. In the morning, they’re the perfect addition to the breakfast burrito. They versaitile, they’re brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before…… </p>

            <h3>Beware the Ides of Starch</h3>
            <p>As a personal favor to me, the potatoes were brought back on March 11, 2021. We’re almost a year out from that triumphant return, and I can confidently say that since then, I have not been unhappy. Rumor has it that even the Nacho Fries are set to make a comeback. Wonders never cease. </p>
